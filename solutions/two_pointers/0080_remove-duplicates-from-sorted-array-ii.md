## Key Insight

The solution uses a two-pointer technique to allow at most two duplicates of each number in the sorted array, effectively filtering out excess duplicates in-place.

## Review Tip

> Always consider edge cases, such as arrays with fewer than three elements, when implementing your solution.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return len(nums)

        w = 2

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[w-2]:
                nums[w] = nums[i]
                w += 1

        return w
```
